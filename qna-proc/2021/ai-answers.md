chain_of_thought To solve this problem, let's break down the number 7.654 and understand the place values:

1. In a decimal number, the digits to the right of the decimal point represent fractional parts.
2. The first digit after the decimal point is in the tenths place.
3. The second digit after the decimal point is in the hundredths place.
4. The third digit after the decimal point is in the thousandths place.

In 7.654:
- 7 is in the ones place
- 6 is in the tenths place
- 5 is in the hundredths place
- 4 is in the thousandths place

Therefore, the digit in the tenths place is 6.

Looking at the given options, we can see that option number 2 corresponds to the correct answer "6".

Question 3: Which number is the smallest?
correct_answers [3]
chain_of_thought To determine which number is the smallest, we need to compare the given decimal numbers:

1. 0.12
2. 0.21
3. 0.102
4. 0.201

Let's arrange these numbers in ascending order:

0.102 < 0.12 < 0.201 < 0.21

0.102 is the smallest number among the given options. This corresponds to option number 3.

Question 4: Which of the following shows $\frac{1}{3}$ of the figure shaded?
correct_answers [1]
chain_of_thought To determine which figure shows 1/3 of the area shaded, we need to analyze each option:

1) This triangle has 1/3 of its area shaded. The shaded part is one of three equal sections.
2) This figure has less than 1/3 shaded. It appears to be closer to 1/4 or 1/5.
3) This square is divided into 8 parts, with 3 parts shaded. This is more than 1/3 (which would be 2.67 parts out of 8).
4) This triangle has more than 1/3 shaded. It looks closer to 1/2 or slightly less.

Therefore, option (1) is the only figure that accurately represents 1/3 of the area being shaded.

Question 5: Which two lines are perpendicular to each other?
correct_answers [2]
chain_of_thought To determine which two lines are perpendicular to each other, we need to look for lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle. Let's analyze the given figure:

1. Line AB is the top line of the triangle.
2. Line DE is a horizontal line that intersects the triangle.
3. Line FG is a diagonal line that intersects the triangle.
4. BC is one of the sides of the triangle.

Perpendicular lines form a right angle (90 degrees) when they intersect. Looking at the figure:

- AB and DE appear to intersect at a right angle. The line DE is horizontal, and AB is part of the triangle that looks to be forming a right angle with DE.
- None of the other line pairs form an obvious right angle.

Therefore, the lines that are perpendicular to each other are AB and DE.

Question 6: Arrange these fractions from the largest to the smallest.
correct_answers [1]
chain_of_thought To solve this problem, we need to compare the given fractions and arrange them from largest to smallest. Let's convert all fractions to decimal form for easier comparison:

1. $\frac{9}{8} = 1.125$
2. $\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$
3. $1\frac{1}{9} = 1 + \frac{1}{9} = 1.111...$

Now, let's arrange them from largest to smallest:

$\frac{5}{4} > \frac{9}{8} > 1\frac{1}{9}$

This corresponds to option 1: $\frac{5}{4}, \quad \frac{9}{8}, \quad 1\frac{1}{9}$

Therefore, the correct answer is option number 1.

Question 7: The circle has centre $O$.
AOE and COF are straight lines. Which pair of lines shows its radius and diameter?
correct_answers [2]
chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the definitions:
   - A radius is a line segment from the center of a circle to any point on its circumference.
   - A diameter is a line segment that passes through the center of a circle and has its endpoints on the circle. It's twice the length of a radius.

2) Looking at the image:
   - O is the center of the circle.
   - AOE and COF are straight lines passing through the center, so they are diameters.
   - OB, OC, OD, and OF are all radii as they go from the center to the circumference.

3) Now, let's examine the options:
   1. AE and OC: AE is a diameter, but OC is a radius.
   2. AO and BD: AO is a radius, and BD is a diameter.
   3. BD and AE: Both are diameters.
   4. OE and FC: OE is a radius, and FC is a diameter.

4) We're looking for a pair that shows a radius and a diameter.

Therefore, the correct answer is option 2: AO (radius) and BD (diameter).

Question 8: The plan of a park is shown in the square grid.
Mandy is in the park. She stands at a location south-east of the statue and west of a bench. In what direction is the shelter from Mandy?
correct_answers [2]
chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. The question states that Mandy is south-east of the statue and west of a bench.

2. Looking at the grid, we can see that the statue is in the top-left quadrant of the park.

3. There are two benches on the grid: one in the left column and one in the right column.

4. Since Mandy is west of a bench, she must be west of the bench in the right column (as being west of the left bench would put her outside the park).

5. So, Mandy's position must be somewhere in the square that is both south-east of the statue and west of the right-side bench.

6. This puts Mandy approximately in the center of the grid.

7. From this central position, we can see that the shelter is located to the south-east of Mandy.

8. Looking at the options, "North-east" (option 2) is the closest direction to south-east.

Therefore, the correct answer is option 2: North-east.

Question 9: A file costs $\$ 3$ more than a pen. The total cost of 5 such files is $\$ y$. Find the cost of a pen.
correct_answers [3]
chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) Let's define variables:
   Let x be the cost of a pen
   Let y be the total cost of 5 files

2) We're told that a file costs $3 more than a pen:
   Cost of a file = x + 3

3) The total cost of 5 files is y:
   5(x + 3) = y

4) Let's solve this equation for x:
   5x + 15 = y
   5x = y - 15
   x = (y - 15) / 5

5) This gives us the cost of a pen in terms of y.

6) Simplify:
   x = y/5 - 3

7) Looking at our options, this matches option 3: $\left(\frac{y}{5}-3\right)$

Therefore, the correct answer is option 3.

Question 10: $\quad \mathrm{ABC}$ is a straight line and $\angle \mathrm{BDA}=\angle \mathrm{CDB}$. Find $\angle A B D$.
correct_answers [3]
chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we note that ABC is a straight line. This means that ∠ABC = 180°.

2) We're given that ∠BDA = ∠CDB. Let's call this angle x°.

3) In triangle ABD:
   - We know ∠BAD = 40° (given in the figure)
   - We're looking for ∠ABD (let's call it y°)
   - The third angle is x° (∠BDA)

4) In triangle BCD:
   - We know ∠BCD = 68° (given in the figure)
   - We have x° again (∠CDB)
   - The third angle must be (180° - 68° - x°) because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°

5) Now, since ABC is a straight line, we can write:
   y° + x° + (180° - 68° - x°) = 180°

6) Simplifying:
   y° + 112° = 180°
   y° = 68°

7) Therefore, ∠ABD = 68°

8) But the question asks for ∠ABD, which is the supplement of 68°:
   ∠ABD = 180° - 68° = 112°

9) Looking at the options, 112° corresponds to option 3.

Question 11: In the number line, what is the value represented by A?
correct_answers [4]
chain_of_thought To solve this problem, let's analyze the number line:

1. The number line is divided into 6 equal parts between 1/2 and 1 1/2.
2. Each part represents (1 1/2 - 1/2) / 6 = 1/6
3. Point A is located at the 5th mark from 1/2.
4. So, the value at A is: 1/2 + (5 * 1/6) = 1/2 + 5/6 = 1 1/3

Now, let's compare this to the given options:
1. 2/3 is less than our result
2. 1 1/4 is less than our result
3. 1 1/6 is less than our result
4. 1 3/10 is closest to our result of 1 1/3

Option 4 (1 3/10) is the closest to the actual value of 1 1/3.

Question 12: Bala used 44 tacks to pin his drawings side by side onto a board as shown.
How many drawings did he pin altogether?
correct_answers [3]
chain_of_thought To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to understand the pattern of how the tacks are used:
   - Each drawing is pinned at its four corners.
   - Adjacent drawings share tacks on their common edge.

2. Let's count the tacks:
   - The first drawing uses 4 tacks (one at each corner).
   - Each subsequent drawing adds 2 new tacks (top and bottom of the right edge).

3. We know that Bala used 44 tacks in total. Let's set up an equation:
   4 + 2x = 44
   Where x is the number of additional drawings after the first one.

4. Solving the equation:
   2x = 44 - 4
   2x = 40
   x = 20

5. Remember, x is the number of additional drawings. We need to add 1 to account for the first drawing:
   Total drawings = x + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21

Therefore, Bala pinned 21 drawings altogether.

Question 13: $A B C D$ is a trapezium with $A B$ parallel to $D C$ and $A B=B C=B D$.
Find $\angle D B C$.
correct_answers [3]
chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) In trapezium ABCD, AB is parallel to DC.

2) We're given that AB = BC = BD. This means that triangle BCD is isosceles, with BC = BD.

3) In the diagram, we can see that angle BAD is 62°.

4) Since AB is parallel to DC, the alternate angles are equal. So, angle BDC is also 62°.

5) In triangle BCD:
   - We know it's isosceles with BC = BD
   - We know angle BDC is 62°
   - Let's call the unknown angle (DBC) as x°

6) In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. So angle BCD is also x°.

7) The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So in triangle BCD:
   62° + x° + x° = 180°
   62° + 2x° = 180°
   2x° = 118°
   x° = 59°

Therefore, angle DBC is 59°.

Question 14: Tim had 13 more two-dollar notes than five-dollar notes at first. He exchanged $\$ 20$ worth of five-dollar notes for two-dollar notes. How many more two-dollar notes than five-dollar notes did Tim have after the exchange?
correct_answers [3]
chain_of_thought Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the initial situation:
   - Tim has 13 more two-dollar notes than five-dollar notes.
   - Let x be the number of five-dollar notes.
   - Then, x + 13 is the number of two-dollar notes.

2. Calculate the exchange:
   - Tim exchanges $20 worth of five-dollar notes for two-dollar notes.
   - Number of five-dollar notes exchanged = $20 ÷ $5 = 4 notes
   - Number of two-dollar notes received = $20 ÷ $2 = 10 notes

3. Calculate the new situation after the exchange:
   - New number of five-dollar notes = x - 4
   - New number of two-dollar notes = (x + 13) + 10 = x + 23

4. Find the difference between two-dollar notes and five-dollar notes:
   - Difference = (x + 23) - (x - 4) = 23 + 4 = 27

Therefore, after the exchange, Tim has 27 more two-dollar notes than five-dollar notes.

Question 15: A box contained brown balls and green balls. $40 \%$ of the balls were green. After some yellow balls were added to the box, $26 \%$ of the balls were green. What percentage of the balls in the box were yellow?
correct_answers [3]
chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) Initially, 40% of the balls were green, which means 60% were brown.

2) After adding yellow balls, the percentage of green balls decreased to 26%. This means the total number of balls increased, but the number of green balls remained the same.

3) Let's say the initial number of balls was 100 (this makes percentages easy to work with).
   - 40 balls were green
   - 60 balls were brown

4) After adding yellow balls, green balls are 26% of the total. Let's call the new total number of balls x.
   - 40 is 26% of x
   - We can write this as an equation: 40 = 0.26x

5) Solving for x:
   x = 40 / 0.26 ≈ 153.85

6) So, the new total is about 154 balls (rounding up).

7) The number of yellow balls added is:
   154 - 100 = 54

8) To find the percentage of yellow balls:
   (54 / 154) * 100 ≈ 35.06%

9) Rounding to the nearest whole percentage, we get 35%.

Therefore, 35% of the balls in the box were yellow, which corresponds to option number 3.
