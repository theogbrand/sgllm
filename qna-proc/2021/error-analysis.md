Question 4: Which of the following shows $\frac{1}{3}$ of the figure shaded?
AI_Answer: [1]
Answer Key Answer: [4]
chain_of_thought To determine which figure shows 1/3 of the area shaded, we need to analyze each option:

1) This triangle has 1/3 of its area shaded. The shaded part is one of three equal sections.
2) This figure has less than 1/3 shaded. It appears to be closer to 1/4 or 1/5.
3) This square is divided into 8 parts, with 3 parts shaded. This is more than 1/3 (which would be 2.67 parts out of 8).
4) This triangle has more than 1/3 shaded. It looks closer to 1/2 or slightly less.

Therefore, option (1) is the only figure that accurately represents 1/3 of the area being shaded.

Question 5: Which two lines are perpendicular to each other?
AI_Answer: [2]
Answer Key Answer: [4]
chain_of_thought To determine which two lines are perpendicular to each other, we need to look for lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle. Let's analyze the given figure:

1. Line AB is the top line of the triangle.
2. Line DE is a horizontal line that intersects the triangle.
3. Line FG is a diagonal line that intersects the triangle.
4. BC is one of the sides of the triangle.

Perpendicular lines form a right angle (90 degrees) when they intersect. Looking at the figure:

- AB and DE appear to intersect at a right angle. The line DE is horizontal, and AB is part of the triangle that looks to be forming a right angle with DE.
- None of the other line pairs form an obvious right angle.

Therefore, the lines that are perpendicular to each other are AB and DE.
