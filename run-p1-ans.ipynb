      "\n",
      "1. Line AB is the top line of the triangle.\n",
      "2. Line DE is a horizontal line that intersects the triangle.\n",
      "3. Line FG is a diagonal line that intersects the triangle.\n",
      "4. BC is one of the sides of the triangle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perpendicular lines form a right angle (90 degrees) when they intersect. Looking at the figure:\n",
      "\n",
      "- AB and DE appear to intersect at a right angle. The line DE is horizontal, and AB is part of the triangle that looks to be forming a right angle with DE.\n",
      "- None of the other line pairs form an obvious right angle.\n",

      "2. $\\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$\n",
      "3. $1\\frac{1}{9} = 1 + \\frac{1}{9} = 1.111...$\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's arrange them from largest to smallest:\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\frac{5}{4} > \\frac{9}{8} > 1\\frac{1}{9}$\n",
      "\n",
      "This corresponds to option 1: $\\frac{5}{4}, \\quad \\frac{9}{8}, \\quad 1\\frac{1}{9}$\n",

      "Question 7: The circle has centre $O$.\n",
      "AOE and COF are straight lines. Which pair of lines shows its radius and diameter?\n",
      "correct_answers [2]\n",
      "chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) First, let's recall the definitions:\n",
      "   - A radius is a line segment from the center of a circle to any point on its circumference.\n",
      "   - A diameter is a line segment that passes through the center of a circle and has its endpoints on the circle. It's twice the length of a radius.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Looking at the image:\n",
      "   - O is the center of the circle.\n",
      "   - AOE and COF are straight lines passing through the center, so they are diameters.\n",
      "   - OB, OC, OD, and OF are all radii as they go from the center to the circumference.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Now, let's examine the options:\n",
      "   1. AE and OC: AE is a diameter, but OC is a radius.\n",
      "   2. AO and BD: AO is a radius, and BD is a diameter.\n",
      "   3. BD and AE: Both are diameters.\n",
      "   4. OE and FC: OE is a radius, and FC is a diameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) We're looking for a pair that shows a radius and a diameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the correct answer is option 2: AO (radius) and BD (diameter).\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 8: The plan of a park is shown in the square grid.\n",
      "Mandy is in the park. She stands at a location south-east of the statue and west of a bench. In what direction is the shelter from Mandy?\n",
      "correct_answers [2]\n",
      "chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The question states that Mandy is south-east of the statue and west of a bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Looking at the grid, we can see that the statue is in the top-left quadrant of the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There are two benches on the grid: one in the left column and one in the right column.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Since Mandy is west of a bench, she must be west of the bench in the right column (as being west of the left bench would put her outside the park).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. So, Mandy's position must be somewhere in the square that is both south-east of the statue and west of the right-side bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. This puts Mandy approximately in the center of the grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. From this central position, we can see that the shelter is located to the south-east of Mandy.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Looking at the options, \"North-east\" (option 2) is the closest direction to south-east.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the correct answer is option 2: North-east.\n",
