      "Let's analyze these numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 0.12 = 0.120 (adding a zero at the end doesn't change the value)\n",

      "2) Figure (2): This is a rectangle divided into three equal vertical sections. One of these sections is shaded, which represents 1/3 of the total area.\n",

      "Question 5: Which two lines are perpendicular to each other?\n",
      "AI_Answer [4]\n",
      "chain_of_thought To determine which two lines are perpendicular to each other, we need to analyze the geometric relationships in the given figure:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Perpendicular lines form a 90-degree angle where they intersect.\n",
      "2. In this figure, we have several intersecting lines, but we need to identify which pair forms a right angle.\n",
      "3. AB and BC are sides of the triangle ABC, so they are not perpendicular.\n",
      "4. AB and DE appear to be parallel, so they are not perpendicular.\n",
      "5. BC and DE intersect, but they don't appear to form a right angle.\n",
      "6. BC and FG, however, seem to intersect at a right angle. This is the key observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In geometric figures, when a line appears to be perpendicular to one side of a triangle and passes through the opposite vertex, it often indicates a perpendicular relationship. In this case, FG passes through vertex C and appears perpendicular to side AB of triangle ABC.\n",

      "1) In a circle, the radius is a line segment from the center to any point on the circumference.\n",
      "2) The diameter is a line segment that passes through the center and has its endpoints on the circumference. It's twice the length of the radius.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Looking at the given options:\n",
      "   - AE passes through the center O and touches the circle at both ends, so it's a diameter.\n",
      "   - OC is a line from the center to the circumference, so it's a radius.\n",
      "   - AO is a radius (from center to circumference).\n",
      "   - BD passes through the center and touches the circle at both ends, so it's a diameter.\n",

      "Mandy is in the park. She stands at a location south-east of the statue and west of a bench. In what direction is the shelter from Mandy?\n",
      "AI_Answer [2]\n",
      "chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We need to first locate Mandy's position based on the given information:\n",
      "   - She is south-east of the statue\n",
      "   - She is west of a bench\n",

      "2. Looking at the grid, we can see that the only position that satisfies both conditions is the square directly south of the statue and directly west of the bench in the bottom-right corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Now that we've located Mandy, we need to determine the direction of the shelter from her position.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The shelter is located two squares north and one square west of Mandy's position.\n",

      "5. When we have a combination of north and west, the resulting direction is north-west.\n",

      "AI_Answer [3]\n",
      "chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Let's define the cost of a pen as x dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) We're told that a file costs $3 more than a pen. So, the cost of a file is (x + 3) dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) We're also told that the total cost of 5 such files is $y. We can express this as an equation:\n",
      "   5(x + 3) = y\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Now, we need to solve for x (the cost of a pen).\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Let's expand the equation:\n",
      "   5x + 15 = y\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Subtract 15 from both sides:\n",
      "   5x = y - 15\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Divide both sides by 5:\n",
      "   x = (y - 15) / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "8) This can be rewritten as:\n",
      "   x = y/5 - 3\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Therefore, the cost of a pen is (y/5 - 3) dollars.\n",

      "AI_Answer [2]\n",
      "chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) First, we note that ABC is a straight line. This means that the angles on this line sum to 180°.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) We're given that ∠BDA = ∠CDB. Let's call this angle x°.\n",

      "   ∠BDA = x° = 36°\n",
      "   \n",
      "8) The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so:\n",

      "1. The number line is divided into 6 equal parts between 1/2 and 1 1/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The total distance between 1/2 and 1 1/2 is 1 whole unit.\n",

      "3. Since this unit is divided into 6 equal parts, each part represents 1/6 of the whole unit.\n",

      "4. Point A is located at the 4th mark after 1/2.\n",

      "5. This means A is 4/6 (or 2/3) of the way from 1/2 to 1 1/2.\n",

      "6. To calculate the value of A:\n",
      "   1/2 + (2/3 * 1) = 1/2 + 2/3 = 3/6 + 4/6 = 7/6 = 1 1/6\n",

      "How many drawings did he pin altogether?\n",
      "AI_Answer [3]\n",
      "chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) First, let's look at the pattern of tacks used for each drawing:\n",
      "   - Each drawing uses 4 tacks (one at each corner).\n",
      "   - However, adjacent drawings share tacks.\n",

      "2) Let's count the tacks:\n",
      "   - The first drawing uses 4 tacks.\n",
      "   - Each subsequent drawing adds only 2 new tacks (right side), as the left side tacks are shared with the previous drawing.\n",

      "chain_of_thought Let's approach this step-by-step:\n",

      "1) Initially, 40% of the balls were green, which means 60% were brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) After adding yellow balls, the percentage of green balls decreased to 26%. This means the total number of balls increased, but the number of green balls remained the same.\n",
